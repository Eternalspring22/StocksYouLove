Corporate Ethics Guide 
*	I have a goal to write and publish a short story every month.
*	My stories are about the relationship between business model and ethics.
*	I want to show how this relationship affects everyone in the world.
*	I also want to show how we can use our knowledge of the system to change the world for the better.
*	I think we can do this by being mindful of how we spend and invest our money.
*	This has implications on what we ask of business and business leaders.
